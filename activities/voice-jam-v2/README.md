## How to speak Native American, Sort Of: A Light-Hearted Lexicon
A humorous interactive tool designed to teach users about native american slang words in a fun engaging way. 

Built with p5.js and p5.speech library for voice recognition and synthesis. It prompts users to learn the pronounciation, meaning and usage of various slang words by repeating them and listening to their definitions or usage examples.

## Features:
Interactive learning: Users interact with application by clicking to get a random native american slang word displayed on the screen. 

Voice Recognition and Synthesis: The application reads out a slang word, and the user is asked to repeat it. Once recognized, the tool reads out the definition and usage of the word.

Dynamic content: A curated list of slang words, each with a unique meaning or usage or scenario providing a rich learning experience.

## Things I wanted to add and or fix/change in the future
Easter egg? Once the user has clicked through and repeated all the words correctly and listened to the definitions I wanted to add a humoruous "state" thanking the user for interacting.

I want to create a drawn shape pixel style of 'Unknown Warrior/William Knifeman' from Rez Dogs as the form of the fortune teller.

Examples of dialoge from TV show I want him to say:

WKM: AHOOOO!
WKM: For I shall give you some native american wisdom here.

WKM: He who hoots with owls at night cannot soar with the eagles in the morning.
WKM: "another example would go here"

WKM: These, are ancient sayings from the heartbeat of mother earth.
WKM: click again for more wisdom

- Can music be added in the background or will that mess with the voice recognition?
