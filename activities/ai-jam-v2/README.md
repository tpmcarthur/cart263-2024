# Aurora Interplay V1
A mini experience/prototype/interactive experience designed to visually recreate the the Northern Lights/Aurora Borealis. 

Focus on the interactive play between human movement and the aurora simulation. 

The use of colours in an array suggests at the gradient like colour often seen in the northern lights, as more people join in and move the colours shift and move together.

Ended up using poseNet, it should be able to detect multiple poses/people in the function gotPoses(results)

# Background 
I've been choosing to focus in incorporating a mix of the visual media art in combination with the creative coding. Each project I am trying to combine and explore new ideas that could lead to bigger projects further on down the road. 

I've always been taught that the Northern Lights are a powerful spiritual experience. I was told it is our ancestors and loved ones who have passed on dancing in the sky. On nights when family members passed the lights exploded in the sky in Southern Saskatchewan.

We collectivley know as a family that the Northern Lights came out that night to carry their spirits home with our ancestors. It is such a beautiful sight to experience. 

I enjoy working through and documenting stories and my life through art - I think it's something that has just been passed down in my blood memory to document. I enjoy using the new tools in this age to express this. 

I hope what I share and create is insightful!

//Main working option around silhoutte

//     const maxDistance = 250; // value for to connect to further stars 

//     stars.forEach(star => {
