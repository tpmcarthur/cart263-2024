A mini experience/prototype designed to visually recreate the the Northern Lights/Aurora Borealis. 

Using ml5 ai, hand detection to showcase movement within the prototype. Hoping to achieve full body recognition on the future but for now I am choosing to go with hand detection.

# Background 
I've been choosing to focus in incorporating a mix of the visual media art in combination with the creative coding. Each project I am trying to combine and explore new ideas that could lead to bigger projects further on down the road. 

I've always been taught that the Northern Lights are a powerful spiritual experience. I was told it is our ancestors and loved ones who have passed on dancing in the sky. When I lost my cousin in 2021, and my mushum in 2023 - both of those nights the northern lights exploded in the sky in Southern Saskatchewan and came right over the house of each of my family members who had passed on. 

We collectivley know as a family that the Northern Lights came out that night to carry their spirits home with our ancestors. It is such a beautiful sight to experience. 

I enjoy working through and documenting stories and my life through art - I think it's something that has just been passed down in my blood memory to document. I enjoy using the new tools in this age to express this. 

I hope what I share and create is insightful!
